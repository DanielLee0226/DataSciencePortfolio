## Front Matter

Install supporting R packages with necessary functions and data sets.

```{r} 
# load packages
library(mosaic)     # includes `mplot()` function as well as both `NCHS` and `CPS85` data sets
library(tidyverse)  # loads a group of useful packages including `ggplot2`
library(DataComputing)
```


###  Problem 5.3 (from DataComputing book)

![](problem5-3.png)

Using the `NCHS` data table, write the `ggplot2` code that reproduces the above graphic.  Note: The "yes" and "no" in the gray bars refer to whether or not the person is pregnant.  Show your R code and the plot it produces using the empty code chunk below.  


```{r}
ggplot( data = NCHS, aes(x = bmi)) + geom_density(adjust = 0.4) + aes(colour = sex) + facet_wrap(~pregnant, ncol = 4) + labs(title = "") + theme(legend.position = "right") 

```



###  Problem 5.4 (from DataComputing book)

![](problem5-4.png)


Using the `CPS85` data table, write the `ggplot2` code that reproduces the above graphic.  Show your R code and the plot it produces using the empty code chunk below.


```{r}
# ggplot(data = CPS85, aes(x = exper, y = wage)) + geom_point()  + aes(colour = married) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + facet_wrap(~sector, ncol = 4) + theme(legend.position = "right") + labs(title = "")


```
